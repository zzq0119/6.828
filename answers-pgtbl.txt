Explain why the third test srcva + len < srcva is necessary in copyin_new(): give values for srcva and len for which the first two test fail (i.e., they will not cause to return -1) but for which the third one is true (resulting in returning -1).

Answer: If p->sz is small, and srcva + len >= 1<<64, in this case `srcva + len < srcva` is true due to overflow. So the third condition is necessary.
